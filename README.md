# UnityViveTest

This project is an initial experiment of integrating VR into a Unity scene of procedural meshes based on some sample CSV data.
Please run scene testProcedural.

## Pre-requisite
If you do not have HTC Vive, you can still run the scene and check it out.

## HTC Vive integration
- VR camera
- VR controller (grab and release objects)

## Unity Scene
- use Procedural Toolkit to generate meshes
- encode attributes of Toronto's census data into the color and the height of cubes
- add collider and rigibody to each mesh upon creation
